!!! construction "Under Construction"
    This page is under construction.

---

!!! note "Further reading"
    This page is currently used to showcase call-outs.

!!! help "What's a call-out?"
    Call-outs are these boxes that you are reading.

??? danger "Open me!"
    These call-outs - also called admonitions - can also be expanded.

???+ warning "You can close me (after reading!)"
    They can also be collapsible and forced open, too.

!!! quote "This docs page was made by @ShaneButt, @reselim, @jakebball11, and @zaiisao."
    We saw a need and decided to take the time to properly document this module.

!!! example "[You can link to URLs and other pages]()"
    It's really simple to link to other pages in call-outs. Just wrap your text with `[` and `]({link})` where `{link}` is the URL or page to link to.

!!! bug "Making new admonitions"
    You can make newly styled admonitions by cloning the template file in `stylesheets/admonitions` and modifying the CSS of the exposed properties. Icons can be retrieved from the material-mkdocs GitHub page, under `docs/.icons/` and then grabbing the SVG code of the icon you want. Then you replace the `<svg>...` code in the new `.css` file.
