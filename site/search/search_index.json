Under Construction This page is under construction. Further reading This page is currently used to showcase call-outs. What's a call-out? Call-outs are these boxes that you are reading. Open me! These call-outs - also called admonitions - can also be expanded. You can close me (after reading!) They can also be collapsible and forced open, too. This docs page was made by @ShaneButt, @jakebball11, and @zaiisao. We saw a need and decided to take the time to properly document this module. You can link to URLs and other pages It's really simple to link to other pages in call-outs. Just wrap your text with [ and ]({link}) where {link} is the URL or page to link to. Making new admonitions You can make new styled admonitions by cloning the template file in stylesheets/admonitions and modifying the css of the exposed properties. Icons can be retrieved from the material-mkdocs github page, under docs/.icons/ and then grabbing the SVG code of the icon you want. Then you replace the <svg>... code in the new .css file.
